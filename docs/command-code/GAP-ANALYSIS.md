# Command Code gap analysis

## Works now

| Capability | Status |
| --- | --- |
| One-command project setup | `npx @kujolang/kujo-cmd setup` release candidate; installs sources, runtime, MCP, skills, and smoke-checks discovery. |
| Local execution | STDIO MCP and canonical Kujo CLIs; no Kujo-hosted service. |
| Dynamic discovery | Profile-filtered catalog with exact schemas, effects, versions, and digests. |
| Profiles | Portable `kujo.ability-profile/v1`; all sources remain installed while exposure changes. |
| Skills | Generated/symlinked from one pinned `kujo-skills` source into `.agents/skills`. |
| Policy and approval | Read allowed; write/delete/external require input-bound, expiring, one-time approval. |
| Receipts | Local append-only JSONL with policy, approval, idempotency, timing, and host/run/session/agent/model correlation. |
| Restart and retry | Persistent approvals/idempotency/receipts survive MCP and host restarts; keyed retries replay receipts. |
| Cancellation/concurrency | MCP cancellation terminates child work; calls run concurrently; state mutation is serialized. |
| Optional Watchdog | Explicit local loopback service start/stop/status and health Ability. |

## Partial or explicit degradation

- Command Code supplies no trustworthy standard MCP session/model/agent
  envelope. `_kujo` correlation fields are preserved but caller-asserted.
- Process termination is best-effort. A killed tool may have completed an
  external effect before cancellation; inspect receipts/artifacts before retry.
- Command Code tool permissions do not mint Kujo approvals. Approval remains a
  separate CLI action so a model cannot approve itself.
- Profiles select tools and corresponding skills, but Command Code currently
  needs a restart/tool refresh after profile changes.
- Watchdog health is integrated; native turn/tool telemetry needs a lifecycle
  API and is therefore not silently claimed.
- Dispatch validation is exposed. Dispatch execution remains authoritative in
  Dispatch and should be added only with its provider and worker dependencies
  expressed as a canonical Ability pack.
- RAG query expects a local index. No remote index is substituted.

## Deliberately not implemented

- Host-named copies of Kujo primitives or skills.
- A managed/hybrid Kujo execution service.
- In-band self-approval.
- Experimental mod hooks as an authorization boundary.
- Command Code agents masquerading as Kujo Chain-of-Command workers.
- Jidoka completion gating without a negotiated fail-closed host lifecycle.

## Remaining worthwhile generic work

A separately versioned Host Capability contract could cover verified host
identity, lifecycle events, native agent workers, telemetry, and candidate
completion gates. It should be implemented only when at least two hosts expose
stable equivalents. Command Code's current mod hooks are useful experimental
input, not yet a safe cross-host contract.
